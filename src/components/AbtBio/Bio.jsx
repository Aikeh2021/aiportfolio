        Hello, my name is Ashley Ikeh and I am a certified Software Developer.
        It's nice to meet you! I received my Bachelor of Science in Psychology
        from the University of Georgia, where I also studied Korean and
        Sociology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to becoming a Developer, my work experience ranged from interning
        with the City of Atlanta to working as a receptionist at a small
        veterinary clinic.
      </p>

      <p>
        After college I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of software
        development, so I chose to study full-stack software development with
        Georgia Institute of Technology. I have developed a solid understanding
        of programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have been
        exposed to libraries like jQuery, Node, and React and have used API's to
        create dynamic websites. Each week I submitted assignments showcasing my
        knowledge of software development, which can be viewed under the
        Projects tab of this site. From finding ways to store data to learning
        about sorting algorithms, my coding bootcamp taught me a wide range of
        knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since bootcamp I have been leading a C# study group and completing
        challenges like 30 Days of JavaScript to learn more about coding. I have
        also been working on projects I hope to unveil in due time!
